# Hairitage
## A website to support the Hairitage mobile application

The hypothetical Hairitage mobile application allows users to store and browse information relating to their history of hairstyles, hence the pun on the word "heritage".

Definitions
In what follows I will use the terms:
- 'barber' to refer to the collection of terms 'barber/stylist/hairdresser/etc.' 
- 'barbershop' to refer to the collection of terms 'barbershop/salon/hairdresser/etc.' 
- 'cut' to refer to the collection of terms 'cut/styling/colouring/etc.'
- 'user' to refer to users of the applications that are not themselves barbers.

The current key features of the application are:
* Allows users to save before and after photos taken at the time of each cut
* Allows users to store the style requested, barbershop attended and the barber that performed the cut
* Allows users to rate their barber, add personal notes and additional photos for future reference
* Allows barbers to leave notes about users' hair that may be useful in the future for both the user and other barbers, e.g. presence of a hidden double crown
